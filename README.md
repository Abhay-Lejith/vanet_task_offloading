Serpentine Environment
======================

The serpentine environment is a VANET simulation using [Veins-Gym](https://github.com/tkn-tub/veins-gym) to combine Veins with Reinforcement Learning.
It was used for the publication ["How to Train your ITS: Integrating Machine Learning with Vehicular Network Simulation"](https://www.ccs-labs.org/bib/schettler2020how/), published at the 2020 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference.

For an example on how to use this environment, please refer to the [jupyter notebook in the examples directory](examples/Tutorial_Using_the_Serpentine_Scenario.ipynb).

For further notes on how this scenario works, please check out the [guide on how to set up your own Veins-Gym environment](https://github.com/tkn-tub/veins-gym/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md).
