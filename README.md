Serpentine Environment
======================

The serpentine environment is a VANET simulation using [Veins-Gym](https://github.com/tkn-tub/veins-gym) to combine Veins with Reinforcement Learning.
It was used for the publication "How to Train your ITS: Integrating Machine Learning with Vehicular Network Simulation", published at the 2020 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference. 

For an example on how to use this example, please refer to the notebook in the examples directory.
