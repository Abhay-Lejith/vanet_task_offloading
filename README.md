Serpentine Environment
======================

The serpentine environment is a VANET simulation using [Veins-Gym](https://github.com/tkn-tub/veins-gym) to combine Veins with Reinforcement Learning.
It was used for the publication "How to Train your ITS: Integrating Machine Learning with Vehicular Network Simulation", published at the 2020 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference.

For an example on how to use this environment, please refer to the [jupyter notebook in the examples directory](examples/Tutorial_Using_the_Serpentine_Scenario.ipynb).
